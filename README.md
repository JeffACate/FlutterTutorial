# TodoCounter

Most to do applications track task and a completion status. Unlike most todo applications this app will track task and how many times it must be completed before it is completed.

Tech Requirements

The main focus is to create a mobile application with Xamarin. For this reason I will be using familiar technologies in other areas such as the SQL front-end and .NET back-end. I may impliment docker containers or netlify to deploy remotely with CI/CD.
